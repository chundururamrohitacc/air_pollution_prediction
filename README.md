# Air pollution prediction #
The measurement of air quality index (AQI) is
very important to describe the air pollution degree and its
impact on human health. Prediction of AQI is very
complex task because of dynamic nature, space of
pollutants and particulate, large variability, and volatility.
This paper presents the popular machine learning
techniques Multi-layer perceptron (MLP), convolution
neural networks (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM),
and Hybrid CNN-LSTM to forecast pollutant and
particulates level for Hyderabad City, India. l. The
experimental results show the MAE of CNN-LSTM is
0.0326 and R2 is 0.8129 for CO, MAE is 0.4315 and R2 is
0.6301 for PM2.5, MAE is 0.0459 and R2 is 0.4820 for
PM10, MAE is 0.0605 and R2 is 0.109 for NO, MAE is
0.0861 AND R2 is 0.7582 for ùëµùë∂ùüê, MAE is 0.0437 and R2
is 0.7963 for NOX, MAE is 0.0801 and R2 is 0.6364 for
NH3, MAE is 0.0500 and R2 is 0.2314 for SO2, MAE is
0.0733 and R2 is 0.3797 for O3.
